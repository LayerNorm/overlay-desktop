/**
 * Extension-local mirror of the `ChatStreamingMode` type exposed by

 *
 * The landing AppSettingsProvider wires React context, WorkOS sync, and
 * localStorage persistence — all of which the side panel supplies via its
 * own `chrome.storage.local`-backed provider. We only need the type here
 * so MarkdownMessage's prop surface stays source-compatible with the
 * synced landing file.
